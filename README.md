# Scripts

Welcome to my collection of scripts designed for managing Unix-based systems. These scripts are maintained by me, [@n0step_](https://github.com/n0step_).

## Overview

This repository contains various scripts that make it easier for me to manage the system. Feel free to explore and utilize them in your own projects!

## Getting Started

```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
```

### Usage

To run a script, simply use the following command:

```bash
./script_name.sh
```
